# UXID

![MIT License][badge_license_url]


**U**ser e**X**perience focused **ID**entifiers (UXIDs) are identifiers which:

* Describe the resource (aid in debugging and investigation)
* Work well with copy and paste (double clicking selects the entire ID)
* Can be shortened for low cardinality resources
* Are secure against enumeration attacks
* Can be generated by application code (not tied to the datastore)
* Are K-sortable (lexicographically sortable by time - works well with datastore indexing)
* Do not require any coordination (human or automated) at startup, or generation
* Are very unlikely to collide (more likely with less randomness)
* Are easily and accurately transmitted to another human using a telephone

Many of the concepts of Stripe IDs have been used in this library.

## Usage
